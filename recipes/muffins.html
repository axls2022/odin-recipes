            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p> A moist, dense and delicious snack. Super easy! I had apples and 
                    zucchini that were just begging to be turned into something 
                    wonderful!
                </p>

                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flower</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded zucchini</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded apple</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 24 muffin cups 
                        with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. 
                        Stir flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder into sugar mixture just 
                        until batter is combined. Fold zucchini and apple into batter and spoon into 
                        the prepared muffin cups.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake in the preheated oven until until muffins spring back after pressing 
                        the top, about 25 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ol>
