            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p> These creamy coconut overnight oats have a great flavor and a boost of protein from 
                    Greek yogurt and chia seeds. I topped them with cacao nibs and almonds, but feel free 
                    to use fresh fruit or any other topping. Add honey or maple syrup if you like them sweeter.
                </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>⅓ cup old-fashioned oats</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup coconut milk beverage</li>
                    <li>¼ cup nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt</li>
                    <li>½ tablespoon chia seeds</li>
                    <li>1 ½ tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut, divided</li>
                    <li>½ tablespoon cacao nibs</li>
                    <li>½ tablespoon sliced almonds</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Combine oats, coconut milk beverage, Greek yogurt, chia seeds, and 1 tablespoon coconut 
                        flakes in an 8-ounce Mason jar. Stir until well combined, and cover with a lid. Refrigerate 
                        for 8 hours, or overnight.
